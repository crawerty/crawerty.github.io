    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      This website was made in an effort to help students improve their musical skills through technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a student who spent time in various choruses, I've always searched for a way to optimize the music learning experience and make rehearsals more efficient. Rehearsals shouldnâ€™t be about figuring out the notes â€” they should focus on matching voices and following the conductor. Thatâ€™s impossible if members donâ€™t understand their music first.
    </p>
    <p>
      With OnSight Music, I hope to offer a tool that helps everyone learn their music in a fun and efficient way.
    </p>

    <h3>Who Itâ€™s For</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, OnSight is designed for chorus members who want to practice their pieces more effectively. By recording yourself singing along to the piece, you can receive feedback on your pitch and rhythm accuracy, allowing you to identify areas for improvement and track your progress over time.
      From my experiences being in choruses like Stuyvesant Oratorio Chorus, and All City Chorus, one issue that always makes music directors scratch their heads is the fact that they have to spend the majority of their rehearsal teaching the music to their members when it should be a time for members to figure out how they are going to perform their piece together, as a choir, assuming everyone knows their stuff.
      <br><br>
      Even if youâ€™re not in a chorus, OnSight can help you learn any piece of music more accurately and efficiently than ever before. While testing this program out, I found it much easier to learn all my pieces when I don't have to guess what note I got wrong and if I really did sing the right rhythm.
